# Primary Goal
This repository contains an HTML and CSS dashboard project that I developed as a learning exercise. The main focus of this project was to create a custom framework from scratch and apply it to build a functional dashboard.

# Features
  - Custom Framework: I created a framework from scratch, which allowed me to have full control over the design and functionality of the dashboard.
  - Responsive Design: The dashboard is designed to be responsive, ensuring optimal viewing experience across different devices and screen sizes.
  - Reusable Components: The framework includes reusable components that contribute to code efficiency and maintainability.
